### Motivation
	My motivation for this project comes from a business that my cousin recently started where he buys salvaged and used cars locally and sells/ships them to Ghana. I see this as a great business idea and with the help of an app to make things more organized and efficient, I think this business can be taken to the next level. Currently, the business functions mostly from direct calls and responses to inquiries from Facebook posts of different available vehicles. I see this as an unorganized way to do business, but the interest from their customers is still there. With an app, I see customers being able to view inventory and make personal requests from one place on their mobile device. Not only will the customer benefit, but the company will benefit from the app being a tool to keep orders and inventory more organized as the company expands.

	As a mother of two teenage boys make the process of buying an inexpensive reliable car more easy for somebody who doesn’t have much knowledge of cars, so that I will ensure my children’s safety and not waste my money on a car that will breakdown in a short amount of time.

	As an entrepreneur in Ghana, I want to be able to utilize a database of cars that I have the option of purchasing with the intention of resale in my own company.
